Purpose and Overview: 
We wanted to see what the alcohol consumption trends are in the United States over the years. This information can be used across many different industries- healthcare (see which states need to cutback on alcohol consumption due to various health reasons), sales (which states are target market for certain alcohol sales).

This project visualizes alcohol consumption data in the United States from the years 1977 - 2016 onto two different HTML pages.


Instructions on how to use and interact with the project: Download the 'Final_Draft' folder and open it inside VS Code. Right-click on the 'draft_index.html' file and click on 'Open with Live Server' to open the webpage. On the webpage, select the year and click on the state markers to view alcohol consumption data for said state in numerical form and in pie chart form. At the bottom of the webpage are buttons that will bring you to another HTML page where you can view alcohol consumption data in bar chart form by year or another HTML page with a static image of a line chart that displays average alcohol consumption by state over time. Data can be chosen to be omitted by clicking on legend at the top of the page.

The original dataset 'Alcohol_Consumption_US.csv' is located in the 'Source_Data' folder. This dataset was then manipulated with Postgresql in pgAdmin4 and used to output multiple CSV files that were used in the creation of our data visualizations. The 'static' folder contains our CSS and JS files in their respective folders that control the data visualization. 

Final version of this project is located within the 'Final_Draft' folder. Other folders include work done by contributors of this project. The dataset in its original form is located in the 'Source_Data' folder. 'Outputs' contains CSVs created using Postgresql in pgAdmin4.


Ethical Considerations: Our dataset was taken from a public kaggle page 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linzey/alcohol-consumption-us' and being used solely for educational purposes. This data is not being used to promote harm of any indivudals nor to condone alcoholism. All visualizations were created with free open source software.
